This topic shows you how to use Windows Azure Mobile Services to leverage data in a Windows Phone 8 app. In this tutorial, you will download an app that stores data in memory, create a new mobile service, integrate the mobile service with the app, and then login to the Windows Azure Management Portal to view changes to data made when running the app.

<div class="dev-callout"><b>Note</b>
<p>This tutorial is intended to help you better understand how Mobile Services enables you to use Windows Azure to store and retrieve data in a Windows Phone 8 app. As such, this topic walks you through many of the steps that are completed for you in the Mobile Services quickstart. If this is your first experience with Mobile Services, consider first completing the tutorial <a href="/en-us/develop/mobile/tutorials/get-started-wp8">Get started with Mobile Services</a>.</p>
</div>

This tutorial walks you through these basic steps:

1. [Download the Windows Phone 8 app project][Developer Code Samples site] 
2. [Create the mobile service]
3. [Add a data table for storage]
4. [Update the app to use Mobile Services]
5. [Test the app against Mobile Services]

This tutorial requires the [Mobile Services SDK] and the [Windows Phone 8 SDK] running on Windows 8. 

<h2><a name="download-app"></a><span class="short-header">Download the project</span>Download the GetStartedWithData project</h2>

This tutorial is built on the [GetStartedWithData app][Developer Code Samples site], which is a Windows Phone 8 app. The UI for this app is identical to the app generated by the Mobile Services quickstart, except that added items are stored locally in memory. 

1. Download the GetStartedWithData sample app from the [Developer Code Samples site]. 

2. In Visual Studio 2012 Express for Windows Phone 8, open the downloaded project and examine the MainPage.xaml.cs file.

   Notice that added **TodoItem** objects are stored in an in-memory **ObservableCollection&lt;TodoItem&gt;**.

3. Press the **F5** key to rebuild the project and start the app.


4. In the app, type some text in the text box, then click the **Save** button.

   ![][0]  

   Notice that the saved text is displayed in the list below.

<h2><a name="create-service"></a><span class="short-header">Create mobile service</span>Create a new mobile service in the Management Portal</h2>

Next, you will create a new mobile service to replace the in-memory list for data storage. Follow these steps to create a new mobile service.

1.	Log into the [Windows Azure Management Portal]. 
2.	At the bottom of the navigation pane, click **+NEW**.

	![][1]

3.	Expand **Compute** and **Mobile Service**, then click **Create**.

	![][2]

    This displays the **New Mobile Service** dialog.

4.	In the **Create a mobile service** page, type a subdomain name for the new mobile service in the **URL** textbox and wait for name verification. Once name verification completes, click the right arrow button to go to the next page.	

	![][3]

    This displays the **Specify database settings** page.

    <div class="dev-callout"> 
	<b>Note</b> 
	<p>As part of this tutorial, you create a new SQL Database instance and server. You can reuse this new database and administer it as you would any other SQL Database instance. If you already have a database in the same region as the new mobile service, you can instead choose <b>Use existing Database</b> and then select that database. The use of a database in a different region is not recommended because of additional bandwidth costs and higher latencies.</p></div>	

5.	In **Name**, type the name of the new database, then type **Login name**, which is the administrator login name for the new SQL Database server, type and confirm the password, and click the check button to complete the process.

	![][4]

    <div class="dev-callout"> 
	<b>Note</b> 
	<p>When the password that you supply does not meet the minimum requirements or when there is a mismatch, a warning is displayed. <br/>We recommend that you make a note of the administrator login name and password that you specify; you will need this information to reuse the SQL Database instance or the server in the future.</p> 
	</div>


You have now created a new mobile service that can be used by your mobile apps. Next, you will add a new table in which to store app data. This table will be used by the app in place of the in-memory collection.

<h2><a name="add-table"></a><span class="short-header">Add a new table</span>Add a new table to the mobile service</h2>

To be able to store app data in the new mobile service, you must first create a new table in the associated SQL Database instance.

1. In the Management Portal, click **Mobile Services**, and then click the mobile service that you just created.

2. Click the **Data** tab, then click **+Create**.

   ![][5]

   This displays the **Create new table** dialog.

3. In **Table name** type _TodoItem_, then click the check button.

  ![][6]

  This creates a new storage table **TodoItem** with the default permissions set, which means that any user of the app can access and change data in the table. 

    <div class="dev-callout"> 
	<b>Note</b> 
	<p>The same table name is used in Mobile Services quickstart. However, each table is created in a schema that is specific to a given mobile service. This is to prevent data collisions when multiple mobile services use the same database.</p> 
	</div>

4. Click the new **TodoItem** table and verify that there are no data rows.

5. Click the **Columns** tab and verify that there is only a single **id** column, which is automatically created for you.

  This is the minimum requirement for a table in Mobile Services. 

    <div class="dev-callout"><b>Note</b>
	<p>When dynamic schema is enabled on your mobile service, new columns are created automatically when JSON objects are sent to the mobile service by an insert or update operation.</p>
    </div>

You are now ready to use the new mobile service as data storage for the app.

<h2><a name="update-app"></a><span class="short-header">Update the app</span>Update the app to use the mobile service for data access</h2>

Now that your mobile service is ready, you can update the app to store items in Mobile Services instead of the local collection. 

0. If you haven't already installed the [Mobile Services SDK], install it now.

1. In the **Project** menu in Visual Studio, click **Add Reference**, then expand **Windows**, click **Extensions**, check **Windows Azure Mobile Services Managed Client**, and click **OK**. 

  ![][7]

  This adds a reference to the Mobile Services client to the project.

2. In both the MainPage.xaml.cs and App.xaml.cs project files, add or uncomment the following **using** statement:

        using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.MobileServices;

3. In the Management Portal, click **Mobile Services**, and then click the mobile service you just created.

4. Click the **Dashboard** tab and make a note of the **Site URL**, then click **Manage keys** and make a note of the **Application key**.

   ![][8]

  You will need these values when accessing the mobile service from your app code.

5. In Visual Studio, open the file App.xaml.cs, uncomment the code that defines the **MobileService** variable, and supply the URL and application key from the mobile service in the **MobileServiceClient** constructor, in that order.

  This creates a new instance of MobileServiceClient that is used to access your mobile service.

6. In the file MainPage.xaml.cs, comment the line that defines the existing **items** collection, and uncomment the following lines:

        private MobileServiceCollectionView<TodoItem> items;
        private IMobileServiceTable<TodoItem> todoTable = 
            App.MobileService.GetTable<TodoItem>();

   This code creates a mobile services-aware binding collection (**items**) and a proxy class for the SQL Database table **TodoItem** (**todoTable**). 

7. In the **InsertTodoItem** method, remove the line of code that sets the **TodoItem**.**Id** property, add the **async** modifier to the method, and uncomment the following line of code:

        await todoTable.InsertAsync(todoItem);

  This code inserts a new item into the table.

8. In the **RefreshTodoItems** method, uncomment the following line of code:

        items = todoTable.ToCollectionView();

   This sets the binding to the collection of items in the todoTable, which contains all TodoItem objects returned from the mobile service. 

9. In the **UpdateCheckedTodoItem** method, add the **async** modifier to the method, and uncomment the following line of code:

         await todoTable.UpdateAsync(item);

   This sends an item update to the mobile service.

Now that the app has been updated to use Mobile Services for backend storage, it's time to test the app against Mobile Services.

<h2><a name="test-app"></a><span class="short-header">Test the app</span>Test the app against your new mobile service</h2>

1. In Visual Studio, press the F5 key to run the app.

2. As before, type text in the textbox, and then click **Save**.

   This sends a new item as an insert to the mobile service.

3. In the [Management Portal], click **Mobile Services**, and then click your mobile service.

4. Click the **Data** tab, then click **Browse**.

   ![][9]
  
   Notice that the **TodoItem** table now contains data, with id values generated by Mobile Services, and that columns have been automatically added to the table to match the TodoItem class in the app.

This concludes the **Get started with data** tutorial for Windows Phone 8.
