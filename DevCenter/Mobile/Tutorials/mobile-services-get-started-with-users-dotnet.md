# Get started with authentication in Mobile Services

Language: **C# and XAML**

This topic shows you how to authenticate users in Windows Azure Mobile Services from a Windows Store app.  In this tutorial, you add authentication to the quickstart project using Live Connect. When successfully authenticated by Live Connect, a logged-in user is welcomed by name and the user ID value is displayed.  

This tutorial walks you through these basic steps to enable Live Connect authentication:

1. [Register your app for authentication and configure Mobile Services]
2. [Restrict table permissions to authenticated users]
3. [Add authentication to the app]

This tutorial requires the [Live SDK for Windows], and you must have already completed the tutorial [Get started with Mobile Services].

## <a name="register"></a>Register your app

To be able to authenticate users, you must register your Windows Store app at the Live Connect Developer Center. You must then register the client secret to integrate Live Connect with Mobile Services.

1. In Visual Studio 2012 Express for Windows 8, open the project that you created when you completed the tutorial [Get started with Mobile Services].

2. In solution explorer, double-click the file **Package.appxmanifest**, click the **Packaging** tab, and then make a note of the values of **Package display name** and **Publisher**. 

  ![][0]

  You will need these values to register your app.

3. Navigate to the [Windows Push Notifications & Live Connect] page, log on with your Microsoft account, if needed, and then follow the instructions to register your app.

4. Make a copy of the **Package name** value generated by the site after you have successfully registered your app.

   ![][8]

4. In Visual Studio, paste the copied value in **Package name** in the application manifest.

   ![][1]

5. Log on to the [Windows Azure Management Portal], click **Mobile Services**, and then click your app.

   ![][2]

6. Click the **Dashboard** tab and make a note of the **Site URL** value.

   ![][9]

    You will use this value to define the redirect domain.

2. Navigate to the [My Apps dashboard] in Live Connect Developer Center and click on your app in the **My applications** list.

   ![][6] 

3. Click **Edit settings**, then **API Settings** and make a note of the value of **Client secret**. 

   ![][7]

   You must provide this value to Mobile Services to be able to use Live Connect for authentication. 

    <div class="dev-callout"><b>Security Note</b>
	<p>The client secret is an important security credential. Do not share the client secret with anyone or distribute it with your app.</p>
    </div>

4. In **Redirect domain**, enter the URL of your mobile service from Step 7, and then click **Save**.

6. Back in the Management Portal, click the **Identity** tab, enter the **Client secret** obtained from Live Connect, and click **Save**.

   ![][3]

Both your mobile service and your app are now configured to work with Live Connect.

## <a name="permissions"></a>Restrict permissions

1. In the Management Portal, click the **Data** tab, and then click the **TodoItem** table. 

   ![][4]

2. Click the **Permissions** tab, set all permissions to **Only authenticated users**, and then click **Save**. This will ensure that all operations against the **TodoItem** table require an authenticated user. This also simplifies the scripts in the next tutorial because they will not have to allow for the possibility of anonymous users.

   ![][5]

3. In Visual Studio 2012 Express for Windows 8, open the project that you created when you completed the tutorial [Get started with Mobile Services]. 

4. Press the F5 key to run this quickstart-based app; verify that an exception with a status code of 401 (Unauthorized) is raised. 
   
   This happens because the app is accessing Mobile Services as an unauthenticated user, but the _TodoItem_ table now requires authentication.

Next, you will update the app to authenticate users with Live Connect before requesting resources from the mobile service.

## <a name="add-authentication"></a>Add authentication

1. Download and install the [Live SDK for Windows].

2. In the project in Visual Studio, add a reference to the Live SDK.

5. Open the project file mainpage.xaml.cs and add the following using statements:

        using Microsoft.Live;
        using Windows.UI.Popups;

6. Add the following code snippet that creates a member variable for storing the current Live Connect session and a method to handle the authentication process:
	
        private LiveConnectSession session;
        private async System.Threading.Tasks.Task Authenticate()
        {
            LiveAuthClient liveIdClient = new LiveAuthClient("<< INSERT REDIRECT DOMAIN HERE >>");

            while (session == null)
            {
                // Force a logout to make it easier to test with multiple Microsoft Accounts
                if (liveIdClient.CanLogout)
                    liveIdClient.Logout();
	
                LiveLoginResult result = await liveIdClient.LoginAsync(new[] { "wl.basic" });
                if (result.Status == LiveConnectSessionStatus.Connected)
                {
                    session = result.Session;
                    LiveConnectClient client = new LiveConnectClient(result.Session);
                    LiveOperationResult meResult = await client.GetAsync("me");
                    MobileServiceUser loginResult = await App.MobileService.LoginAsync(result.Session.AuthenticationToken);
	
                    string title = string.Format("Welcome {0}!", meResult.Result["first_name"]);
                    var message = string.Format("You are now logged in - {0}", loginResult.UserId);
                    var dialog = new MessageDialog(message, title);
                    dialog.Commands.Add(new UICommand("OK"));
                    await dialog.ShowAsync();
                }
                else
                {
                    session = null;
                    var dialog = new MessageDialog("You must log in.", "Login Required");
                    dialog.Commands.Add(new UICommand("OK"));
                    await dialog.ShowAsync();
                }
            }
         }

    <div class="dev-callout"><b>Note</b>
	<p>This code forces a logout, when possible, to make sure that the user is prompted for credentials each time the application runs. This makes it easier to test the application with different Microsoft Accounts to ensure that the authentication is working correctly. This mechanism will only work if the logged in user does not have a connected Microsoft account.</p>
    </div>
	

7. Update string _<< INSERT REDIRECT DOMAIN HERE >>_ from the previous step with the redirect domain that was specified when setting up the app in Live Connect, in the format **https://_service-name_.azure-mobile.net/**.

8. Replace the existing **OnNavigatedTo** event handler with the handler that calls the new **Authenticate** method:

        protected override async void OnNavigatedTo(NavigationEventArgs e)
        {
            await Authenticate();
            RefreshTodoItems();
        }
		
9. Press the F5 key to run the app and sign into Live Connect with your Microsoft Account. 

   When you are successfully logged-in, the app should run without errors, and you should be able to query Mobile Services and make updates to data.

In the next tutorial, [Authorize users with scripts], you will take the user ID value provided by Mobile Services based on an authenticated user and use it to filter the data returned by Mobile Services.
