#How to Use Media Services

This guide shows you how to start programming with Windows Azure Media Services. The guide includes a technical overview of Media Services, steps to configure your Windows Azure account for Media Services, a setup guide for development, and topics that show how to accomplish typical programming tasks. The scenarios demonstrated include: uploading assets, encrypting or encoding assets, and delivering assets by downloading or by generating URLs for streaming content. The samples are written in C# and use the Media Services SDK for .NET. For more information on Windows Azure Media Services, refer to the [Next Steps][] section.

You can also program Media Services using the OData-based REST APIs. You can build an application making REST API calls to Media Services from .NET languages or other programming languages. For a full documentation series on programming with the Media Services REST API, see [Building Applications with the Windows Azure Media Services REST API](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=252967). To start programming with REST, first enable your Windows Azure account for Media Services as described in the section [Setting Up a Windows Azure Account for Media Services][].

<h2><span class="short header"><a name="what-are"> </a>What are Media Services?</span></h2> 
Windows Azure Media Services form an extensible media platform that integrates the best of the Microsoft Media Platform and third-party media components in Windows Azure. Media Services provide a media pipeline in the cloud that enables industry partners to extend or replace component technologies. ISVs and media providers can use Media Services to build end-to-end media solutions. This overview describes the general architecture and common development scenarios for Media Services.

The following diagram illustrates the basic Media Services architecture.

![Media Services Architecture][]

###Media Services Feature Support
The current release of Media Services provides the following feature set for developing media applications in the cloud. For information on future releases, see [Media Services Upcoming Releases:  Planned Feature Support][].

- **Ingest**. Ingest operations bring assets into the system, for example by uploading them and encrypting them before they are placed into Windows Azure Storage. By the RTM release, Media Services will offer integration with partner components to provide fast UDP (User Datagram Protocol) upload solutions.
- **Encode**. Encode operations include encoding, transforming and converting media assets. You can run encoding tasks in the cloud using the Media Encoder that is included in Media Services. Encoding options include the following:
   - Use the Windows Azure Media Encoder and work with a range of standard codecs and formats, including industry-leading IIS Smooth Streaming, MP4, and conversion to Apple HTTP Live Streaming.
   - Convert entire libraries or individual files with total control over input and output.
   - A large set of supported file types, formats, and codecs (see [Supported File Types for Media Services][]).
   - Supported format conversions. Media Services enable you to convert ISO MP4 (.mp4) to Smooth Streaming File Format (PIFF 1.3) (.ismv; .isma). You can also convert Smooth Streaming File Format (PIFF) to Apple HTTP Live Streaming (.msu8, .ts).
- **Protect**. Protecting content means encrypting live streaming or on demand content for secure transport, storage, and delivery. Media Services provide a DRM technology-agnostic solution for protecting content.  Currently supported DRM technologies are Microsoft PlayReady Protection and MPEG Common Encryption. Support for additional DRM technologies will be available. 
- **Stream**. Streaming content involves sending it live or on demand to clients, or you can retrieve or download specific media files from the cloud. Media Services provide a format-agnostic solution for streaming content.  Media Services provide  streaming origin support for Smooth Streaming, Apple HTTP Live Streaming, and MP4 formats. Support for additional formats will be available. You can also seamlessly deliver streaming content by using Windows Azure CDN or a third-party CDN, which enables the option  to scale to millions of users.   


###Media Services Client Development
Extend the reach of your Media Services solution by using SDKs and player frameworks to build media client applications. These clients are for developers who want to build Media Services applications that offer compelling user experiences across a range of devices and platforms. Depending on the devices that you want to build client applications for, there are options for SDKs and player frameworks available from Microsoft and other third-party partners.  

The following provides a list of available client SDKs and player frameworks.  For more information on these and other planned SDKs and player frameworks, and the functionality they can support, see [Media Services Client Development][]. 

-   **Mac and PC client support**.  Use Microsoft Silverlight to develop streaming clients.
-   **Windows 8 desktop applications**. Windows 8 supported development languages and constructs including HTML, Javascript, XAML, C# and C+.
-   **Embedded or dedicated devices**. Devices such as connected TVs, set-top boxes, Blu-Ray players, OTT TV boxes, and mobile devices that have a custom application development framework and a custom media pipeline.
-   **Windows Phone**. Use a Microsoft SDK to build premium Windows Phone applications.
-   **iOS devices**. Use a Microsoft SDK to build clients for iPhone, iPod, and iPad.
-   **Android devices**. Use SDKs provided by Microsoft partners to build Android clients.


###Development Scenarios
Media Services support several common media development scenarios as described in the following table.

In this case the project is a C# Windows console application, but the same setup steps shown here apply to other types of projects you can create for Media Services applications (for example, a Windows Forms application or an ASP.NET Web application).

   1. In Visual Studio, create a new C# Windows console application based on .NET Framework 4.0. Enter the **Name**, **Location**, and **Solution name**, and then click **OK**.

   ![Visual Studio Project Setup][]

   2. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click on the project node, select **Properties**, and then in the **Application** properties, set the **Target Framework** setting to *.NET Framework 4*.
   3. Add a project reference to the following Windows Azure SDK storage client assembly. To add an assembly, in **Solution Explorer** right-click the **References** node for your project. Select **Add Reference**, then browse to the desired assembly (or assemblies), select, and click **OK**.
   <br />
   Default installation path:  C:\Program Files\Windows Azure SDK\v1.6\bin\
   - Microsoft.WindowsAzure.StorageClient.dll
   4. Add references to the following assemblies from WCF Data Services.
   <br />
   Default installation path:  C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft WCF Data
   - Microsoft.Data.Edm.dll
   - Microsoft.Data.OData.dll
   - Microsoft.Data.Services.Client.dll
   - Microsoft.Data.Services.dll
   - System.Spatial.dll
   5. Add a reference to the following assembly from the Media Services SDK.
   <br />
   Default installation path:  C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Windows Azure Media Services\Services SDK\v1.0\
   - Microsoft.WindowsAzure.MediaServices.Client.dll
   6. Add a reference to the .NET Framework 4 assembly named System.Configuration. You can find this assembly on the **.NET** tab of the **Add References** dialog.
   7. Add the following using statement to the top of any code modules (before the namespace declaration) to reference the required namespaces for the Media Services SDK.

   using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.MediaServices.Client;

At this point, you are ready to start developing a Media Services application.    
   
<h2><span class="short header"><a name="connect"> </a>How to: Connect to Media Services programmatically</span></h2> 

Nearly everything you do in Media Services programming requires you to have a reference to the server context object. The server context gives you programmatic access to all Media Services programming objects.

To get a reference to the server context, return a new instance of the context type as in the following code example. Pass your Media Services account name and account key (which you obtained during the account setup process) to the constructor. 

	static CloudMediaContext GetContext()
	{
	    // Gets the service context. 
	    return new CloudMediaContext(_accountName, _accountKey);
	} 

It is often useful to define a module-level variable of type **CloudMediaContext** to hold a reference to the server context returned by a method such as **GetContext**. The rest of the code examples in this topic use a variable called **_context** to refer to the server context. 

<h2><span class="short header"><a name="create-asset"> </a>How to: Create an encrypted Asset and upload to storage</span></h2>

To get media content into Media Services, first create an asset and add files to it, and then upload the asset. This process is also called ingesting content. You can create an asset, add files, and upload it with a single line of code as in the following example. To encrypt an asset for transport and storage to protect its contents, pass the parameter **AssetCreationOptions.StorageEncrypted** to the method. To keep the asset unencrypted, pass the parameter **AssetCreationOptions.None** to the method.

The following line of code creates an asset with a single file, encrypts the asset for storage and transport, and uploads the asset to the server.

	IAsset theAsset = _context.Assets.Create(inputMediaFilePath,
	    AssetCreationOptions.StorageEncrypted);

<h2><span class="short header"><a name="get-mediaproc"> </a>How to: Get a Media Processor instance</span></h2>

In Media Services a media processor is a component that handles a specific processing task, such as encoding, format conversion, encrypting, or decrypting media content. You typically create a media processor when you are creating a task to encode, encrypt, or convert the format of media content.

The following table provides the name and description of each available media processor.

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" style="border: 2px solid #000000;">
  <thead>
    <tr>
       <th>Media Processor Name</th>
       <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>Windows Azure Media Encoder</td>
        <td>Lets you run encoding tasks using the Media Encoder.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>PlayReady Protection Task</td>
        <td>Lets you encrypt media assets using PlayReady Protection.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>MP4 to Smooth Streams Task</td>
        <td>Lets you convert media assets from .mp4 to smooth streaming format.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Smooth Streams to HLS Task</td>
        <td>Lets you convert media assets from smooth streaming to the Apple HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) format.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Storage Decryption</td>
        <td>Lets you decrypt media assets that were encrypted using storage encryption.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<br />

To create a media processor instance, create a method like the following example, and pass to it the string name of one of the listed media processors. The code example assumes the use of a module-level variable named **_context** to reference the server context as described in the section [How to: Connect to Media Services Programmatically][].

	private static IMediaProcessor GetMediaProcessor(string mediaProcessor)
	{
	    // Query for a media processor to get a reference.
	    var theProcessor =
	                        from p in _context.MediaProcessors
	                        where p.Name == mediaProcessor
	                        select p;
	    // Cast the reference to an IMediaprocessor.
	    IMediaProcessor processor = theProcessor.First();
	
	    if (processor == null)
	    {
	        throw new ArgumentException(string.Format(System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture,
	            "Unknown processor",
	            mediaProcessor));
	    }
	    return processor;
	}

<h2><span class="short header"><a name="encode-asset"> </a>How to: Encode an Asset</span></h2>

For media content on the server, you can encode the content with a number of media encodings and formats using Windows Azure Media Encoder. You can also use an encoder provided by a Media Services partner; third-party encoders are available through the [Windows Azure Marketplace][]. You can specify the details of encoding tasks by using preset strings defined for your encoder, or by using preset configuration files. 

The following steps are required to encode media content using the Media Encoder:

   1. Create an asset (or reference an existing asset).
   2. Declare a new job, using the **Jobs.Create** method.
   3. Declare a media processor to process the job. To do this, implement a method such as the **GetMediaProcessor** method shown in the section [How to: Get a Media Processor Instance][]. In this example, the code uses the Windows Azure Media Encoder to encode the input media file.
   4. Declare a task. To declare a task, you must give the task a friendly name, and then pass to it a media processor instance, a configuration string for handling the processing job, and a **TaskCreationOptions** setting (which specifies whether to encrypt the configuration data).  In this example, the code uses a preset configuration string to tell Media Encoder how to encode the asset. Also in this task example, the code sets **TaskCreationOptions.None** meaning that the configuration data is not encrypted.
   5. Specify an input asset for the task. In this example, the input asset is the one that the code creates in the first step.
   6. Specify an output asset for the task. By default, all assets are created as encrypted for transport and storage in Media Services. To output a clear, unencrypted asset for playback, the code specifies **AssetCreationOptions.None**.
   7. Submit the job. To access the output of a job, reference the job.OutputMediaAssets collection. See the section [How to: Deliver an Asset by Download][].

The following method combines the previous steps to encode a media file:

    static void CreateEncodingJob(string inputMediaFilePath) 
	{ 
	    //Create an encrypted asset and upload to storage. 
	    IAsset asset = _context.Assets.Create(inputMediaFilePath,
	        AssetCreationOptions.StorageEncrypted);
	
	    // Declare a new job.
	    IJob job = _context.Jobs.Create("My encoding job");
	    // Get a media processor reference, and pass to it the name of the 
	    // processor to use for the specific task. Use a method like the 
	    // GetMediaProcessor method shown in this document.
	    IMediaProcessor processor = GetMediaProcessor("Windows Azure Media Encoder");
	    // Create a task with the encoding details, using a string preset.
	    ITask task = job.Tasks.AddNew("My encoding task", 
	        processor, 
	        "H.264 256k DSL CBR", 
	        TaskCreationOptions.None);
	    // Specify the input asset to be encoded.
	    task.InputMediaAssets.Add(asset);
	    // Add an output asset to contain the results of the job. 
	    // This output is specified as AssetCreationOptions.None, which 
	    // means the output asset is in the clear (unencrypted). 
	    task.OutputMediaAssets.AddNew("Output asset",
	        true,
	        AssetCreationOptions.None);

	    // Launch the job. 
	    job.Submit();
	}

<h2><span class="short header"><a name="playready"> </a>How to: Protect an Asset with PlayReady Protection</span></h2>

In Media Services you can submit a job that integrates with Microsoft PlayReady Protection to encrypt a set of media files. The code in this section takes several streaming files from an input folder, creates a task and encrypts them with PlayReady Protection. 

There are several required steps to create a simple job to provide PlayReady Protection.

   1. It shows how to retrieve configuration data. You can get example configuration files from the task preset reference material in the [Windows Azure Media Services Documentation][].
   2. It creates an asset. The  **_context.Assets.CreateFromDirectory** method used in the example requires you to specify a primary file from a directory of files that you want to encrypt. A primary file is required for media file types that use a manifest (for example, streaming files), or for media files that have external linked resources (for example, QuickTime files).
   3. The code gets a media processor for PlayReady Protection processing, as described in the section [How to: Get a Media Processor Instance][].
   4. The code creates a job, and then creates a task that specifies the use of protected configuration (**TaskCreationOptions.ProtectedConfiguration**). This protects the data in the configuration file by encrypting it.

The following code example shows how to implement the steps:

	static void CreatePlayReadyProtectionJob(string configFilePath,
	    string inputFolder,
	    string primaryFilePath)
	{
	    // Read the encryption configuration data into a string. 
	    string configuration = File.ReadAllText(Path.GetFullPath(configFilePath + @"\PlayReady Protection.xml"));
	
	    // Create an asset from a directory of streaming input files, 
	    // and encrypt the asset.
	    IAsset asset = _context.Assets.CreateFromDirectory(inputFolder,
	        primaryFilePath,
	        AssetCreationOptions.StorageEncrypted);
	
	    // Declare a new job.
	    IJob job = _context.Jobs.Create("My first PlayReady Protection Job");
	    // Get a media processor reference, and pass to it the name of the 
	    // processor to use for the specific task.
	    IMediaProcessor processor = GetMediaProcessor("PlayReady Protection Task");
	
	    // Create a task and run a job using PlayReady Protection to encrypt the asset.
	    // The TaskCreationOptions parameter lets you specify encryption options for
	    // the task configuration data. 
	    //      None:  no encryption.
	    //      ProtectedConfiguration: encrypts the task configuration data before 
	    //        upload. 
	    ITask task = job.Tasks.AddNew("My PlayReady Protection Task",
	        processor, 
	        configuration,
	        TaskCreationOptions.ProtectedConfiguration);
	
	    // Specify the input asset to be encoded.
	    task.InputMediaAssets.Add(asset);
	    // Add an output asset to contain the results of the job. Since the
	    // asset is already protected with PlayReady, we won't encrypt. 
	    task.OutputMediaAssets.AddNew("Output asset", 
	        true, 
	        AssetCreationOptions.None);
	
	    // Launch the job. 
	    job.Submit();
	}


<h2><span class="short header"><a name="manage-asset"> </a>How to: Manage Assets in storage</span></h2>

After you create media assets and upload them to Media Services, you can access and manage the assets on the server. You can also manage other objects on the server that are part of Media Services, including jobs, tasks, access policies, locators, and more.

The following example shows how to query for and return a reference to an asset , when you have an Id for the asset. 

	static IAsset GetAsset(string assetId)
	{
	    // Use a LINQ Select query to get the asset 
	    // from the context assets collection.
	    var asset =
	        from a in _context.Assets
	        where a.Id == assetId
	        select a;
	    // Reference the asset as an IAsset.
	    IAsset theAsset = asset.FirstOrDefault();
	}


To delete an asset, call the **Delete** method on the collection of assets. You can also call **Delete** methods on objects in other collections, such as jobs.

	_context.Assets.Delete(asset);

To list all assets that you have available on the server, you can use code similar to the following example. Iterate through the assets collection, and optionally, you can display details about each asset.

	static void ListAssets()
	{
	    string waitMessage = "Building the list. This may take a few "
	        + "seconds to a few minutes depending on how many assets "
	        + "you have."
	        + Environment.NewLine + Environment.NewLine
	        + "Please wait..."
	        + Environment.NewLine;
	    Console.Write(waitMessage);
	
	    // Create a Stringbuilder to store the list that we build. 
	    StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder();
	
	    foreach (IAsset asset in _context.Assets)
	    {
	        // Display the collection of assets.
	        builder.AppendLine("");
	        builder.AppendLine("******ASSET******");
	        builder.AppendLine("Asset ID: " + asset.Id);
	        builder.AppendLine("Name: " + asset.Name);
	        builder.AppendLine("==============");
	        builder.AppendLine("******ASSET FILES******");
	
	        // Display the files associated with each asset. 
	        foreach (IFileInfo fileItem in asset.Files)
	        {
	            builder.AppendLine("Name: " + fileItem.Name);
	            builder.AppendLine("Size: " + fileItem.ContentFileSize);
	            builder.AppendLine("==============");
	        }
	    }
	
	    // Display output in console.
	    Console.Write(builder.ToString());
	}


<h2><span class="short header"><a name="download-asset"> </a>How to: Deliver an Asset by download</span></h2>

This section shows options for delivering media assets that you have previously added to Media Services. You can deliver Media Services content in numerous application scenarios. You can download media assets, or access them by using locator URLs (these are the delivery scenarios described in this topic). You can send media content to another application or to another content provider. For improved performance and scalability, you can also deliver content by using a Content Delivery Network (CDN), such as the Windows Azure CDN.

The code example in this section shows how to download media assets from Media Services. You can pass in an existing job reference, and then access its **OutputMediaAssets** collection (which is the set of one or more output media assets that results from running a job). This code example shows how to download output media assets from a job, but you can apply the same approach to download other assets.

	static void DownloadAssetToLocal(IJob job, string outputFolder)
	{
	    // Get a reference to the first output asset.  You could also 
	    // iterate through the OutputMediaAssets here and handle each one.
	    IAsset outputAsset = job.OutputMediaAssets[0];
	
	    // There will be a wait time while your files download.
	    Console.WriteLine();
	    Console.WriteLine("Files are downloading...please wait.");
	    Console.WriteLine();
	
	    // Download all files in the output asset, and display the 
	    // output path for each file.
	    foreach (IFileInfo outputFile in outputAsset.Files)
	    {
	        // Download the output file, which contains encoded contents. 
	        string localDownloadPath = Path.GetFullPath(outputFolder + @"\" + outputFile.Name);
	        Console.WriteLine("File is downloading to:  " + localDownloadPath);
	        outputFile.DownloadToFile(Path.GetFullPath(outputFolder + @"\" + outputFile.Name));
	        Console.WriteLine();
	    }
	}

<h2><span class="short header"><a name="stream-asset"> </a>How to: Deliver streaming content</span></h2>

In addition to downloading media content from Media Services, you can use adaptive streaming to deliver content. For example, you can create a direct URL, called a locator, to streaming content on a Media Services origin server. Client applications such as Microsoft Silverlight can play the streaming content directly if you provide the locator.

The following code example shows the necessary steps to create an origin locator for an output asset produced by a job. The example assumes that you have already obtained a reference to an asset that contains smooth streaming files, and the variable named **assetToStream** is referenced in the code. After you have run this code to generate an origin locator on the asset, you should be able to use the resulting locator URL to directly play back the streaming content in a streaming client player such as Silverlight.

To create an origin locator to streaming content, follow these steps:

   1. Get a reference to the streaming manifest file in the asset. This is the file with the .ism extension.
   2. Define an access policy. This is how you determine the type of permissions and the duration for accessing an asset.
   3. Create the origin locator by calling the **CreateOriginLocator** method. Pass to the method an existing asset with streaming media files, an access policy, and a start time. The URL returned by the **CreateOriginLocator** method is only the base path to the asset. To construct a full URL to the streaming manifest file, you must complete the following step.
   4. Build a URL to the manifest file. To do this, add the manifest file name, followed by the string **/manifest** to the locator **Path** property.

The following code shows how to implement the steps:

	static void GetStreamingOriginLocator(IAsset assetToStream)

<h2><span class="short header"><a name="stream-HLS"> </a>How to: Deliver Apple HLS streaming content</span></h2>

A previous section shows how to create a locator to streaming media content on a Media Services origin server. This section shows how to create a locator to Apple HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) content on a Media Services origin server. Using this approach, you can build a URL to Apple HLS content, and provide it to Apple iOS devices for playback. The basic approach to building the locator URL is the same. Build a locator to the Apple HLS streaming asset path on an origin server, and then build a full URL that links to the manifest for the streaming content.

The following code example assumes that you have already obtained a reference to an HLS streaming asset, and the variable named **assetToStream** is referenced in the code. After you have run this code to generate an origin locator on the asset, you can use the resulting URL to play back the streaming content in an iOS device such as an IPAD or an IPhone.

To build a locator to Apple HLS streaming content, perform these steps as shown in the code example:

   1. Get a reference to the manifest file in the asset.
   2. Define an access policy.
   3. Create the locator by calling the **CreateOriginLocator** method. Pass to the method an existing HLS asset with streaming media files, an access policy, and a start time. The URL returned by the **CreateOriginLocator** method is only the base path to the asset. To construct a full URL to the streaming manifest file, complete the following step.
   4. Build a URL to the manifest file. To do this, add the manifest file name, followed by the string **/manifest(format=m3u8-aapl)** to the locator **Path** property.

The following code shows how to implement the steps:

	static void GetStreamingHLSOriginLocator(IAsset assetToStream)
	{
	    // Get a reference to the manifest file from the collection 
	    // of files in the asset. 
	    var theManifest =
	                        from f in assetToStream.Files
	                        where f.Name.EndsWith(".ism")
	                        select f;
	    // Cast the reference to a true IFileInfo type. 
	    IFileInfo manifestFile = theManifest.First();
	
	    // Create an 1-day readonly access policy. 
	    IAccessPolicy streamingPolicy = _context.AccessPolicies.Create("Streaming policy",
	        TimeSpan.FromDays(1),
	        AccessPermissions.Read);
	    ILocator originLocator = _context.Locators.CreateOriginLocator(assetToStream,
	        streamingPolicy,
	        DateTime.UtcNow.AddMinutes(-5));
	
	    // Create a full URL to the manifest file. Use this for playback
	    // in iOS streaming media clients. 
	    string urlForClientStreaming = originLocator.Path
	        + manifestFile.Name + "/manifest(format=m3u8-aapl)";
	    Console.WriteLine("URL to manifest for client streaming: ");
	    Console.WriteLine(urlForClientStreaming);
	    Console.WriteLine();
	}

<h2><span class="short header"><a name="enable-cdn"> </a>How to: Enable Windows Azure CDN</span></h2>

You can use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to improve performance, scalability, and availability of content provided over the Internet. This section describes how to enable a Windows Azure CDN with a Media Services origin server.

###Prerequisites

You must have a Windows Azure CDN configured for an existing Windows Azure Storage account.  See the following topic:  [Getting Started with the Windows Azure CDN][]. 


###Enabling a Windows Azure CDN for Media Services

*After you follow these setup steps, expect a two to three-week delay before your Windows Azure CDN endpoint is enabled.  You will receive a confirmation email when the endpoint is enabled.  For updates on the status of Media Services including the Windows Azure CDN capability, see the [Media Services Forum][].*

To enable your Windows Azure CDN endpoint with a Media Services origin, send email to [MediaServices@Microsoft.com][] and include the following information:

-   Your Media Services account name (you created this account when you followed the directions in the section [Setting Up a Windows Azure Account for Media Services][]).
-   Your Windows Azure CDN endpoint that has been configured against an existing Windows Azure Storage account.   You can get your endpoint by following these steps:
    1. Log into the [Windows Azure Management Portal][].
    2. In the navigation pane, click the option for **Hosted Services, Storage Accounts & CDN**. 
    3. In the upper part of the navigation pane, click **CDN** (you may have to scroll to find this option). 
    4. Select the CDN endpoint associated with the storage account.  
    5. In the **Properties** for the CDN endpoint, copy the value for the **Default HTTP endpoint**.  This is the value to supply in your email.
