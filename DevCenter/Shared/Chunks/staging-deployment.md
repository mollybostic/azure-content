# Staging an application in Windows Azure

A packaged application can be deployed to the staging environment in
Windows Azure to be tested before you move it to the production
environment in which the application is accessible on the Internet. The
staging environment is exactly like the production environment, except
that you can only access the staged application with an obfuscated (GUID-based) URL that is generated by Windows Azure. After you have verified that your application is working correctly, it can be deployed to the production
environment by performing a Virtual IP (VIP) swap.

This task includes the following steps:

-   [Step 1: Stage an application by using the Management Portal][]
-   [Step 1 (Alternate): Stage an application with Visual Studio][]
-   [Step 2: Deploy an application to production by swapping VIPs][]

<h2><span class="short-header">Stage using Management Portal</span>Step 1: Stage an application by using the Management Portal</h2>

This task covers how to stage an application by using the Windows Azure
Management Portal. You can also [Stage an application with Visual
Studio][Step 1 (Alternate): Stage an application with Visual Studio].

1.  Log on to the [Windows Azure Management Portal].

2.  In the Management Portal, click **New**, click **Compute**, click **Cloud service**, and then click **Custom create**.

    ![cloud service dialog][new-cloud-service]

3.  Specify the **URL**, **Region/Affinity Group**, and **Subscription** to use for the cloud service. Ensure that **Deploy a cloud service package now** is checked and click **Next**.

	![custom create cloud service][custom-create-page1]

4.  In the **Publish your cloud service** dialog, fill in the required information and for **Environment** select **Staging**. (If any of your roles contain a single instance, ensure **Deploy even if one or more roles contain a single instance** is checked.) Click **Complete** to create the cloud service.

	![publish cloud service][custom-create-page2]

5.  After the cloud service is created and the staging status has
    been updated to **Running**, select the **Dashboard** and then select **Staging**. 

	![cloud service dashboard][cloud-service-dashboard]

6. Note the value in the **Site URL** entry on the right. The DNS name is an obfuscated GUID-based name generated by Windows Azure.

    ![site url][cloud-service-staging-url]

Click the value listed for **Site URL**. Now you can verify that the application is working correctly in the staging environment by using the staging site URL.

For an upgrade scenario, in which the staged application is an upgraded
version of one that has already been deployed to production, you can
 [upgrade the application in the production environment by swapping the
VIPs][Step 2: Deploy an Application to Production by Swapping VIPs].

<h2><span class="short-header">Stage with Visual Studio</span>Step 1 (Alternate): Stage an application with Visual Studio</h2>

This task covers how to stage an application with Visual Studio. You can
also [Stage an Application with the Management Portal][Step 1: Stage an Application by Using the Management Portal].

<div class="dev-callout">
<b>Note</b>
<p>This step requires Visual Studio 2012 and the Windows Azure
SDK for .NET.</p>
</div>

1.  Start Visual Studio 2012 and open a cloud project that is ready for
    deployment.

2.  In the Solution Explorer, right-click the name of your project, and
    click **Publish**. The **Publish Windows Azure Application** wizard
    appears.

3.  In the **Windows Azure Publish Sign In** dialog, select the named
    authentication credentials you want to use, and then click **Next**.
    For more information, see [Setting up named authentication credentials].

4.  In **Windows Azure Publish Settings**, select the cloud service in which to publish the application, and then for **Environment**, select
    **Staging**.

    ![][3]

5.  Use the defaults for the rest of the settings and click **Next**.

6.  In **Windows Azure Publish Summary**, review the settings, ensure
    **Environment** is set to **Staging**, and then click **Publish**.

Visual Studio starts the publishing process of packaging the application
and then deploying it to Windows Azure. After several minutes, the
deployment is completed.

Now you can verify that the application is working correctly in the
staging environment.

For an upgrade scenario, in which the staged application is an upgraded
version of one that has already been deployed to production, you can
[upgrade the application in the production environment by swapping the
VIPs][Step 2: Deploy an application to production by swapping VIPs].

<a name="step2"> </a>
<h2><span class="short-header">Deploy by swapping VIPs</span>Step 2: Deploy an application to production by swapping VIPs</h2>

After you have verified the upgraded version of an application in the
staging environment, you can quickly make it available in production by
swapping the virtual IPs (VIPs) of the staging and production
environments.

<div class="dev-callout">
<strong>Note</strong>
<p>This step assumes that you have already deployed an
application to production and staged the upgraded version of the
application.</p>
</div>

1.  Log into the [Windows Azure Management Portal],
    click **Cloud Services** and then select the cloud service name.

2.  From the **Dashboard**, select **Staging**, and then click **Swap** at the bottom of the page. This opens the **VIP Swap** dialog.

	![VIP swap dialog][vip-swap-dialog]

3.  Review the information, and then click **Yes**. The two deployments
    begin updating as the staging deployment switches to production and
    the production deployment switches to staging.

You have successfully staged a deployment and upgraded a production
deployment by swapping VIPs with the deployment in staging.
