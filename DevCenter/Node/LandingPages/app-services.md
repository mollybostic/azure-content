<h2>Messaging and Integration</h2>
<h3><a href="/en-us/develop/nodejs/how-to-guides/service-bus-queues/">Send and receive messages with Service Bus Queues</a></h3>
<p>Service Bus Queues offer simple first in, first out guaranteed message delivery and support a range of standard protocols (REST, AMQP, WS*) and APIs to put and pull messages on and off a queue.</p>

<h3><a href="/en-us/develop/nodejs/how-to-guides/service-bus-topics/">Develop a pub/sub app with Service Bus Topics</a></h3>
<p>Service Bus Topics provide a publish/subscribe messaging model to support one-to-many communication. You can optionally register filter rules for a topic on a per-subscription basis, which allows you to restrict which messages to a topic are received by which topic subscriptions.</p>

<h3><a href="/en-us/develop/nodejs/how-to-guides/queue-service/">Communicate between instances with Windows Azure Queues</a></h3>
<p>Windows Azure Queues store large numbers of messages that can be accessed from anywhere in the world via authenticated calls using HTTP or HTTPS. Common uses of Queue storage include creating a backlog of work to process asynchronously, and passing messages from a Windows Azure Web role to a Windows Azure Worker role.</p>

<h2>Caching and CDN</h2>
<h3><a href="/en-us/develop/nodejs/common-tasks/cdn/">Serve high bandwidth content with CDN</a></h3>
<p>The Windows Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) offers a global solution for delivering high-bandwidth content by caching blobs and static content at physical nodes around the world. This common task describes how to enable CDN and add, access, and delete content.</p>

<h2>Additional Services</h2>
<h3><a href="/en-us/develop/nodejs/how-to-guides/sendgrid-email-service/">Send email via SendGrid</a></h3>
<p>Windows Azure applications can use SendGrid to include email functionality. SendGrid provides reliable email delivery, real-time analytics, and flexible APIs that allow users to easily incorporate the service into their Windows Azure applications.</p>
