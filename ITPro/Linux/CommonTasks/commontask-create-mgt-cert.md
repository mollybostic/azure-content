#Create management certificates for Linux in Windows Azure

<div chunk="../../shared/chunks/disclaimer.md" />

A management certificate is needed anytime that you want to use the Service Management API to interact with the Windows Azure image platform. 

There is already documentation on how to create and manage these certificates at [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsazure/gg551721.aspx](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsazure/gg551721.aspx) or you can also use OpenSSL to create the management certificate.  For more information, see [OpenSSL](http://openssl.org/). However, this documentation  is primarily focused on the use of the Silverlight portal that might not be accessible to all the Linux users. It describes how you will be able to gain access to these certificates and integrate them with our different tools, partners and use them on your own until this functionality is added in the Windows Azure (Preview) Management Portal.

<h2 id="createcert">How to: Create and upload a management certificate</h2>


We have created an easy way for you to create a management certificate for Windows Azure by visiting: [https://windows.azure.com/download/publishprofile.aspx](https://windows.azure.com/download/publishprofile.aspx)

This website will ask you to login using your portal credentials and then generate a management certificate  for you that is packaged along with your subscriptionID  on a publishsettings file that you will be asked to download. 

![linuxcredentials](../media/linuxcredentials.png)

Make sure you save this file in safe place as you will not be able to recover it and will need to generate a new management cert. (There is a limit for the total number of certs that you can use in the system. See the appropriate section on this website to confirm this.) You can then use this certificate in multiple ways:

###In Visual Studio###

![VSpublish](../media/VSpublish.png)


###In the Linux Windows Azure Command Line###

You can import the certificate so that you can use it by running the Windows Azure account import command:

![cmdlinepublish](../media/cmdlinepublish.png)

With any other partner or software where you need the tool you will need to extract the management cert from within the file itself and Base 64 decode it. Some partners such as ScaleXtreme and SUSE Studio will consume the file directly in their current form. 

In order to extract the management cert you will need to follow this procedure.

You will need to extract from that file the base 64 encoded content between the  quotes after ManagementCertificate.

	?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
	<PublishData>
	  <PublishProfile
	    PublishMethod="AzureServiceManagementAPI"
	    Url="https://management.core.windows.net/"
	    ManagementCertificate="xxxxx”>
	    <Subscription
	      Id="8a4a0a51-728e-482e-8daa-c477f03c541d"
	      Name="hjereztest" />

	</PublishData>
	
You will need to copy that into a file and then decode it using a base 64 decoder in Linux you can use:

	Base64 –d [encodedfile] > [decodedfile].pfx

This will provide you a pfx file that you can either convert to other formats using openssl  to extract the private key if needed:

 	openssl.exe pkcs12 -in publicAndprivate.pfx -nocerts -out privateKey.pem 

In Windows you can decode and extract the PFX file using powershell or a free windows base 64 decoder such as [http://www.fourmilab.ch/webtools/base64/base64.zip]()  by running the command 

	base64 -d key.txt ->key.pfx

####Cert Generation limit####

There is a limit of up to 10 certs that you can create in the platform with this tool.
Unfortunately there is no way for you to recover the keys that you have generated once they have been generated as we do not save these private keys anywhere in the system.
If you reach the limit of certs in the system you will need to contact support through the Windows Azure forums in order to have your certificates erased or use a browser that can render the old Silverlight portal to perform these tasks.

####If your private key is compromised ####

If your private key is compromised at any point you will need to use a browser that supports Silverlight to access the old portal and delete the corresponding management cert on file or contact support through the forums.  
Generating a new cert is not enough since all 10 certificates are valid and your old compromised key will still be able to access the website.

###Post Preview timeframe story###

At some point after preview you will be able to use the new portal to get access to all the management cert functionality.

<h2 id="servicemanagement">How to: Create a management certificate using the Windows Azure Management Portal</h2>

You can read more on how to create the certificate at [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsazure/gg551721.aspx](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsazure/gg551721.aspx) or you can also use OpenSSL to create the management certificate.  For more information, see [OpenSSL](http://openssl.org).  After you create the certificate, you must add it to your subscription in Windows Azure. 

1.	Sign in to the Windows Azure Management Portal.
2.	In the upper-left corner of the Management Portal, click **Preview**, and then click **Previous Management Portal**.

	![preview](../media/preview.png)


3.	In the navigation pane, click **Hosted Services, Storage Accounts & CDN**. 
4.	At the top of the navigation pane, click **Management Certificates**.
5.	On the ribbon, in the **Certificates** group, click **Add Certificate**.
6.	In **Choose a subscription**, select the Windows Azure subscription to which you want to add the management certificate.
7.	In **Certificate file**, browse to the certificate file, and then click OK.

###Obtain the thumbprint of the certificate and the subscription ID###

You need the thumbprint of the management certificate that you added and you need the subscription ID to be able to upload the VHD file to Windows Azure.

1.	While still in the previous Management Portal, click **Hosted Services, Storage Accounts & CDN**, and then click **Management Certificates**.
2.	In the center pane, click your certificate, and then record the thumbprint from the Properties pane by copying and pasting it to a location where you can retrieve it later.

You also need the ID of your subscription to upload the VHD file.

1.	In the previous Management Portal, click **Hosted Services, Storage Accounts & CDN**, and then click **Hosted Services**.
2.	In the center pane, select your subscription, and then record the subscription ID from the Properties pane by copying and pasting it to a location where you can retrieve it later.

###Providing this information to tools if  you generated your own key###

####For CSUPLOAD

1.	Open a Windows Azure SDK Command Prompt window as an administrator.
2.	Set the connection string by using the following command and replacing **Subscriptionid** and **CertThumbprint** with the values that you obtained earlier:


		csupload Set-Connection "SubscriptionID=<Subscriptionid>;CertificateThumbprint=<Thumbprint>;ServiceManagementEndpoint=https://management.core.windows.net"

####For Linux Azure command line tools

You will need to base 64 encode the  PFX file you created using openssl with command:

 		Base64 [file] > [econded file]

You will then need to merge your subscription ID and the base64 encoded pfx into a single file that has the structure: 

		?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
		<PublishData>
		  <PublishProfile
		    PublishMethod="AzureServiceManagementAPI"
		    Url="https://management.core.windows.net/"
		    ManagementCertificate="xxxxx”>
		    <Subscription
		      Id="8a4a0a51-728e-482e-8daa-c477f03c541d"
		      Name="hjereztest" />
		  </PublishProfile>
		</PublishData>
		
Where xxxxx is the contents of the [enconded file] you will use to provide the details to the Linux Windwos Azure Command Line Tools with the commands:
Azure account import (File)
