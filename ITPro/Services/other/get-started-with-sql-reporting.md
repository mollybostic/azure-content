#Getting started with Windows Azure SQL Reporting#

In this tutorial you will learn about how to manage an instance of SQL Reporting report server and other administrative tasks through SQL Reporting Management portal.

##What is SQL Reporting?
Windows Azure SQL Reporting is a cloud-based reporting service built on Windows Azure and SQL Server Reporting Services technologies. By using SQL Reporting, you can easily provision and deploy reporting solutions to the cloud, and take advantage of a distributed data center that provides enterprise-class availability, scalability, and security with the benefits of built-in data protection and self-healing.

To get started with SQL Reporting, you must have a Windows Azure subscription. You can use an existing subscription, a new subscription, or the free trial subscription. For more information, see [Windows Azure Offers][].

<h2 id="CreateRSS">Create a report server</h2>
Use the **Create Server** wizard to quickly and easily create a new report server in SQL Reporting. The wizard guides you though the steps to choose a subscription and region and provide the user name and password of the server administrator.

1. On the taskbar, click **Create** in the **Server** category. The **Create Server** wizard opens. 

	![CreateServerOption][]

2. On the **Create a SQL Reporting server** page, from the **Subscription** list select the subscription to which you want to add the report server. 

	![CreateServerDialog][]

3. From the **Region** list, select a region. You can create only one report server in each region for each subscription. Click **Next**.
4.	On this page, type the user name of the report server administrator and in Password and Confirm Password type the administrator password. 

	Be sure to keep this information in a safe place. You need it to access the report server. 

	![CreateServerCred][]

5.	Click **Finish**.

The report server is created using the specified subscription.
The report server name is a 10 character GUID. If you do not see the server, expand the subscription in which you created it.


<h2 id="CreateUser">Create a user and assign roles</h2>
1.	Click **Manage** in the **User** category of the taskbar. The **Manage Users** dialog box opens.

	![ManageUserDialog][]

3.	The **Create User** dialog box opens. 
	
	![CreateUserCred][]

4.	 Enter user name and password, select an item role, and optionally assign a system role. Click OK.
	
	_User names must be unique. If you provide a duplicate name, an error message displays and you cannot continue until you change the user name to one that is unique._

	![FolderProperties][]
 
4.	The Edit Folder dialog box opens.

	To update permissions of a Folder, you can optionally click Permissions in the Folder category of the portal ribbon.
	 
	![Permissions][]

	Roles assignments of an item are automatically inherited from the folder that contains the item.

	By default, the root folder has the permissions granted to the report server administrator. When you update permissions on a folder, permissions on its child folders are updated as well. 
 
	_Because the root folder has no physical folder for you to select, you can set permissions on the root folder of the server only by clicking Permissions in the Folder category on the toolbar._ 

2.	Optionally, locate users by typing in the box next to the search icon or filter by role by selecting a role in the role list that is located to the right of the box.
3.	Click the user for whom you want to update role assignments on the selected folder.

	_The user list includes the report server administrator. This user is grayed out and you cannot change its item roles. The administrator is automatically assigned the Content Manager and System Administrator roles when it is first created. These roles provide the highest permissions and you cannot lessen the administrator’s permissions by assigning item roles with lower permissions._
4.	Select and clear role assignments.

5.	Click **OK**.
