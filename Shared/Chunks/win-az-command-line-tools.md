#Windows Azure command-line tool for Mac and Linux#

This tool provides functionality for creating, deploying, and managing virtual machines and websites from Mac and Linux desktops. This functionality is similar to that provided by the Windows PowerShell cmdlets that are installed with the Windows Azure SDKs for .NET, Node.JS, and PHP.

To install the tool on a Mac, download and run the [Windows Azure SDK installer](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=252249).

To install the tool on Linux, install the latest version of Node.JS and then use NPM to install:

    npm install azure-cli -g

Optional parameters are shown in square brackets (for example, [parameter]). All other parameters are required.

In addition to command-specific optional parameters documented here, there are three optional parameters that can be used to display detailed output such as request options and status codes. The -v parameter provides verbose output, and the -vv parameter provides even more detailed verbose output. The --json option will output the result in raw json format.

##<a id="Manage_your_account_information_and_publish_settings"></a>Manage your account information and publish settings
Your Windows Azure subscription information is used by the tool to connect to your account. This information can be obtained from the Windows Azure portal in a publish settings file as described here. The publish settings file can then be imported as a persistent local config setting that the tool will use for subsequent operations. You only need to import your publish settings once.

**account download [options]**

This command launches a browser to download your .publishsettings file from the Windows Azure portal.

	~$ azure account download
	info:   Executing command account download
	info:   Launching browser to https://windows.azure.com/download/publishprofile.aspx
	help:   Save the downloaded file, then execute the command
	help:   account import <file>
	info:   account download command OK

**account import [options] &lt;file>**

This command imports a publishsettings file or certificate so that it can be used by the tool going forward.

	~$ azure account import publishsettings.publishsettings
	info:   Importing publish settings file publishsettings.publishsettings
	info:   Found subscription: 3-Month Free Trial
	info:   Found subscription: Pay-As-You-Go
	info:   Setting default subscription to: 3-Month Free Trial
	warn:   The 'publishsettings.publishsettings' file contains sensitive information.
	warn:   Remember to delete it now that it has been imported.
	info:   Account publish settings imported successfully

Note: The publishsettings file can contain details (that is, subscription name and ID) about more than one subscription. When you import the publishsettings file, the first subscription is used as the default description. To use a different subscription, run the following command.

	~$ azure config set subscription <other-subscription-id>

**account clear [options]**

This command removes the stored publish settings that have been imported. Use this command if you're finished using the tool on this machine and want to assure that the tool cannot be used with your account going forward.

	~$ azure account clear
	Clearing account info.
	info:   OK

**account affinity-group list [options]**

This command lists your Windows Azure affinity groups.

Affinity groups can be set when a group of virtual machines spans multiple physical machines. The affinity group specifies that the physical machines should be as close to each other as possible, to reduce network latency.
 
	~$ azure account affinity-group list
	+ Fetching affinity groups

##<a id="Commands_to_manage_your_Azure_virtual_machines"></a>Commands to manage your Windows Azure virtual machines
The following diagram shows how Windows Azure virtual machines are hosted in the production deployment environment of a Windows Azure cloud service.
 
![Azure Technical Diagram](../media/architecturediagram.jpg)

**create-new** creates the drive in blob storage (that is, e:\ in the diagram); **attach** attaches an already created but unattached disk to a virtual machine.

**vm create &lt;dns-prefix> &lt;image> &lt;userName> [password] [optional parameters]**

This command creates a new Windows Azure virtual machine. By default, each virtual machine is created in its own cloud service; however, you can specify that a virtual machine should be added to an existing cloud service through use of the -c option as documented here.

Note that the vm create command, like the Windows Azure portal, only creates virtual machines in the production deployment environment. There is currently no option for creating a virtual machine in the staging deployment environment of a cloud service. Note that a Windows Azure storage account is created by this command if one does not already exist for your subscription.

When you create a new virtual machine, you will need to specify the physical location (that is, data center) where the virtual machine will reside. You can specify a location through the --location parameter, or you can specify an affinity group through the --affinity-group parameter. If neither is provided, you are prompted to provide one from a list of valid locations.

The supplied password must be 8-123 characters long and meet the password complexity requirements of the operating system that you are using for this virtual machine.

If you anticipate the need to use SSH to manage a deployed Linux virtual machine (as is usually the case), you must enable SSH via the -s option when you create the virtual machine. It is not possible enable SSH after the virtual machine has been created.

Windows virtual machines can enable RDP later by adding port 3389 as an endpoint.

The following optional parameters are supported for this command:

**-c, --connect** create the virtual machine inside an already created deployment in a hosting service. If -vmname is not used with this option, the name of the new virtual machine will be generated automatically.<br />
**-n, --vm-name** Specify the name of the virtual machine. This parameter takes hosting service name by default. If -vmname is not specified, the name for the new virtual machine is generated as &lt;service-name>&lt;id>, where &lt;id> is the number of existing virtual machines in the service plus 1 For example, if you use this command to add a new virtual machine to a hosting service MyService that has one existing virtual machine, the new virtual machine is named MyService2.<br /> 
**-u --blob-url** Specify the blob storage URL from which to create the virtual machine system disk. <br />
**-z, --vm-size** Specify the size of the virtual machine. Valid values are "extrasmall", "small", "medium", "large", "extralarge". The default value is "small". <br />
**-r, --rdp [port]** Adds RDP connectivity to a Windows virtual machine. <br />
**-e, --ssh [port]** Adds SSH connectivity to a Linux virtual machine. This option can be used only when the virtual machine is created. <br />
**-s, --subscription &lt;id>** specifies the subscription id to be used. <br />
**-l, --location** specifies the location (for example, "North Central US"). <br />
**-a, --affinity-group** specifies the affinity group.<br />
**-w, --virtual-network-name** Specify the virtual network on which to add the new vitual machine. Virtual networks can be set up and managed from the Windows Azure portal.<br />
**-b, --subnet-names** Specifies the subnet names to assign the virtual machine.

In this example, MSFT__Win2K8R2SP1-120514-1520-141205-01-en-us-30GB is an image provided by the platform. For more information about operating system images, see vm image list.

##<a id="Commands_to_manage_your_Azure_virtual_machine_endpoints"></a>Commands to manage your Windows Azure virtual machine endpoints
The following diagram shows the architecture of a typical deployment of multiple instances of a virtual machine. Note that in this example port 3389 is open on each virtual machine (for RDP access), and there is also an internal IP address (for example, 168.55.11.1) on each virtual machine that is used by the load balancer to route traffic to the virtual machine. This internal IP address can also be used for communication between virtual machines.

![Windows Azure Network Diagram](../media/networkdiagram.jpg)
 
External requests to virtual machines go through a load balancer. Because of this, requests cannot be specified against a particular virtual machine on deployments with multiple virtual machines. For deployments with multiple virtual machines, port mapping must be configured between the virtual machines (vm-port) and the load balancer (lb-port).

**vm endpoint create &lt;vm-name> &lt;lb-port> [vm-port]**

This command creates a virtual machine endpoint.

	~$ azure vm endpoint create my-vm 8888 8888

<span id="Commands_to_manage_your_Azure_virtual_machine_images"></span>
##Commands to manage your Windows Azure virtual machine images
Virtual machine images are captures of already configured virtual machines that can be replicated as required.

**vm image list [options]**

This command gets a list of virtual machine images. There are three types of images: images created by Microsoft, which are prefixed with "MSFT", images created by third parties, which are usually prefixed with the name of the vendor, and images you create. To create images, you can either capture an existing virtual machine or create an image from a custom .vhd uploaded to blob storage. For more information about using a custom .vhd, see vm image create.
The -json option specifies that the results are returned in raw JSON format. 

	~$ azure vm image list

**vm image create &lt;name> [source-path]**

This command creates a virtual machine image. Your custom .vhd files are uploaded to blob storage, and then the virtual machine image is created from there. You then use this virtual machine image to create a virtual machine. The Location and OS parameters are required.

Some systems impose per-process file descriptor limits. If this limit is exceeded, the tool displays a file descriptor limit error. You can run the command again using the -p &lt;number> parameter to reduce the maximum number of parallel uploads. The default maximum number of parallel uploads is 96.

<span id="Commands_to_manage_your_Azure_virtual_machine_data_disks"></span>
##Commands to manage your Windows Azure virtual machine data disks
Data disks are .vhd files in blob storage that can be used by a virtual machine. For more information about how data disks are deployed to blob storage, see the Windows Azure technical diagram shown earlier. 

The commands for attaching data disks (azure vm disk attach and azure vm disk attach-new) assign a Logical Unit Number (LUN) to the attached data disk, as required by the SCSI protocol. The first data disk attached to a virtual machine is assigned LUN 0, the next is assigned LUN 1, and so on.

When you detach a data disk with the azure vm disk detach command, use the &lt;lun&gt; parameter to indicate which disk to detach. Note that you should always detach data disks in reverse order, starting with the highest-numbered LUN that has been assigned. The Linux SCSI layer does not support detaching a lower-numbered LUN while a higher-numbered LUN is still attached. For example, you should not detach LUN 0 if LUN 1 is still attached.

**vm disk show [options] &lt;name>**

This command shows details about a Windows Azure disk.

	info:   vm disk delete command OK

**vm disk create &lt;name> [source-path]**

This command uploads and registers a Windows Azure disk. --blob-url, --location, or --affinity-group must be specified. If you use this command with [source-path], the .vhd file specified is uploaded and a new image is created. You can then attach this image to a virtual machine by using vm disk attach.

Some systems impose per-process file descriptor limits. If this limit is exceeded, the tool displays a file descriptor limit error. You can run the command again using the -p &lt;number> parameter to reduce the maximum number of parallel uploads. The default maximum number of parallel uploads is 96.
